# Treadmill-Nanny
Nag me to get moving on the treadmill

Components:
Hall Effect Sensor - to detect magnet on flywheel
Bracket to mount HE Sensor
** CUrrent theory is to use a bolt w/ spacer instead of bracket?
Cable (use cat5?

Sensors
* Hall Effect (to count spins of flywheel)
* Motion detect (to tell that I'm standing there)

Buttons
* Sleep for xMin

LEDs
* Warning that detecting presense, but no activity
* Alert to start moving?



Thoughts
* Might need to use Arduinno to count flywheel steps
* Or build a step counter, which sounds too complicated

Crazy future
* graph activity throughout day (rrdtool?)
* Notify me to pickup pace
* Integrate with calendar to tell me when I need to "increase speed" based upon how I've categorized the meeting itself
